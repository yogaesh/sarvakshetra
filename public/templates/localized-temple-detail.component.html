The belief is the malevolent planet is worshipped before entering the inner sanctum of Lord Siva.It has been revered by the hymns of 7th century Tamil saivite poets and is classified as one of the 275 temples categorized under &quot;Paadal Petra Sthalam&quot;. Constructed by chozha kings, this Siva temple is counted as one of the Navagraha Temples for planet Saturn. Tirugnana Sambandar, a 7th-century Tamil Saivite poet, venerated Naganathar in ten verses in Tevaram, compiled as the First Tirumurai. Appar, a contemporary of Sambandar, also venerated Dharbaranyeswarar in 10 verses in Tevaram, compiled as the Fifth Tirumurai. It is the staunch belief and experience too that those afflicted by the adverse effects of Saturn get a relief after praying to the Saturn in the Darbaranyeswarar temple.
